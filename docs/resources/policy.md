Policy resource

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "crosswire_policy" "resource_name" {
  owner = {
    email_address = "user@crosswire.io"
  }
  name = "test policy"
  entitlements = [
    {
      provider = "CROSSWIRE"
      subject  = "SUBJECT"
      object   = "OBJECT1"
    },
    {
      provider = "CROSSWIRE"
      subject  = "SUBJECT"

## Schema

### Required

- `condition` (Attributes) Conditions necessary to become eligible for this policy. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--condition))
- `entitlements` (Attributes Set) Set of Provider-Subject-Object tuples corresponding to what access users will receive upon getting access to the policy. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--entitlements))
- `name` (String) Name of the policy. This is what users will see when requesting access.
- `owner` (Attributes) Email address of user creating the policy. This email address should exist within Crosswire. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--owner))

### Optional

- `approval_behavior` (String) ANY requires only one approval from the set of approvers specified
ALL requires approvals from every approver in order to gain access. When selecting this, make sure to have a small number of approvers to reduce in-flight time to gain access.
- `entitlement_approvers` (Attributes Set) Set of provider-subject-object tuples whose users will be approving requests to this policy.
Typically these would be group memberships rather than application access. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--entitlement_approvers))
- `special_approver` (String) AUTO will automatically grant the policy if eligible.
Self will grant the policy once requested.
Manager requires the subject's manager to approve access.
If this is set to anything besides "NONE", don't set user_approvers or entitlement_approvers.
- `ttl` (Number) Maximum number of seconds a user can hold the policy any given time
- `user_approvers` (Attributes Set) Set of users (email addresses) who will be approving requests to this policy. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--user_approvers))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Crosswire policy id
- `last_updated` (String) Timestamp Terraform received the policy's latest update
- `state` (String) Current state of the policy

Optional:

- `entitlements` (Attributes Set) Set of provider-subject-object tuples governing the truth value of this condition block. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--condition--entitlements))
- `subconditions` (Attributes Set) Set of subconditions governing the truth value of this condition block. If you need more than 3 levels of subconditions, please contact someone at Crosswire for assistance. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--condition--subconditions))
